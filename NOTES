REMEMBER
Normalize my UV coords
U(x) coord should be divided by 2Pi
V(y) coord should be divided by Pi 
This will let the hemisphere access the whole range of coordinates

Focus on the interior object
Get it to reflect using a light and camera then worry about sphere
Use equation from the slides to get it to work

Use slides
